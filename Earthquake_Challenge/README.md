# Earthquake Map 

The purpose of the this project is to build and interactive visualization of earthquakes in the last 7 days. 

The map built has multiple layers that can be toggled on and off. 
Layers include one showing all earthquakes in the data set, one showing only "major" earthquakes (those of magnitude 4.5 or higher, and then a last layer showing tectonic plate lines. 

Clicking on each circle marker will show the magnitude and the city and country of where the earthquake occurred
